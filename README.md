# The-Gaming-Room
A repo for my Operating Platforms class

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room are a game development team, creator of the game "Draw It Or Lose It", they are requesting support to develop the video game "Draw It Or Lose It". They requested that we design it around having only one instance of a particular game at a time. Secondly they asked to port their android-only game to other platforms, mainly have the game run on web browsers.

3. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I felt like the research that was done in order to complete this documentation gave me a very strong insight into other OS and systems that I have personally never used. The recommendations section is especially something that I am confident in. There is no best OS or system, they each have their own use cases and user base and each person will prefer one rather than the other. I tried to stay as objective in my recommendations as to let the client on their own decide what is best for the company.


4. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   Working through the domain model and UML diagram was an immense help at developing the code. Mapping out the classes and how they relate to each other whether through association or inheritance helped me in the developing process.

5. If you could choose one part of your work documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to choose a part on the documents to revise it would be the evaluation section. I feel as though I did well in researching what each operating systems and what each had to offer but since then I have learned alot more information and would iterate once more to add more info.

6. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
   When developing software you must consider the user stories and see from their perspective. It all comes down to the user, if the user gets no value from using your software then there is no use in utilizing it. We tried to create a smooth experience from beginning to end by implementing systems that are efficient and ultimately fun for the user since it is a game after all.

7. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  When first designing software it's important to note that you will not stick to the original design as you will iterate       and change ideas as you progress through the project. With this in mind it's still important to at least design a broad     idea with the defined constraints. A good strategy to design this is with the use of various tools that can help in the       creation of your plans, tools like the UML diagram and pseudocode gave me a strong foundation of what is required.
