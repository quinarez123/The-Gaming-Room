# The-Gaming-Room
A repo for my Operating Platforms class

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room are a game development team, creator of the game "Draw It Or Lose It"

3. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

4. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   Working through the domain model and UML diagram was an immense help at developing the code. Mapping out the classes and how they relate to each other whether through association or inheritance helped me in the developing process.

5. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

6. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the the user's needs when designing?

7. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
